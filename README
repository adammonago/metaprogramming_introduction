A Ruby Metaprogramming Introduction is an article in Ruby source code form.

Read and run metaprogramming_introduction.rb.

It was originally published on the Practical Ruby blog. A while back though I started 
updating it to be more useful and translating it to use Rspec instead of the funny 
little Test::Unit extension (since Rspec reads just as well but is more likely to be 
familiar to a reader). 

Once it's all translated I may put it out as a nicely readable blog post again, but for 
now it'll just live here in Git. Chances are it reads better in your editor of choice 
than on a web page anyway.

As I'm currently midstream on moving from Test::Unit + extensions to Rspec, things are 
a bit messy. You might prefer to read the originally published version at this URL:

If you're running the latest version, you can't run it via Rspec's "spec" executable at 
the moment, since I'm still relying on some Test::Unit stuff. For now, stick with this 
if you want to run it from the command line, though the output will be unimpressive:
