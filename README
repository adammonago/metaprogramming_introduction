A Ruby Metaprogramming Introduction is an article in Ruby source code form.

Read and run metaprogramming_introduction.rb.

It was originally published on the Practical Ruby blog. A while back though I started 
updating it to be more useful and translating it to use Rspec instead of the funny 
little Test::Unit extension (since Rspec reads just as well but is more likely to be 
familiar to a reader). 

Once it's all translated I may put it out as a nicely readable blog post again, but for 
now it'll just live here in Git. Chances are it reads better in your editor of choice 
than on a web page anyway.

The originally published version can be viewed on GitHub at this URL:

http://github.com/duelinmarkers/metaprogramming_introduction/tree/9cd27dd8571b4428ef791ffa53646f4dd799b573

You can run the current version with

  ruby metaprogramming_introduction.rb

or if you want to make it output-heavy

  spec -f specdoc metaprogramming_introduction.rb
